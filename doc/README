Fluvium is a fun physics simulation which lets you play with different
materials, simulated with 2D particles. You can create your own materials and
change the gameplay.

Fluvium is written in C, and it uses SDL and OpenGL for portable graphics.
Most platforms should be supported, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.
You will need the development tools and library headers:

- SDL 1.2 or higher with development files
- SDL_ttf 2.0 or higher with development files
- OpenGL development files

Note that I have not extensively tested the compile process on platforms
besides Mac OS X. To compile on OS X, you will need UNIX-form (not framework)
versions of SDL and SDL_ttf. Other platforms, as well as SDL frameworks on OS
X, will require some tweaking of the Makefile and headers.

Make sure that the configuration file is present at data/config.txt before you
run Fluvium. This file contains all the materials used in the game; without
it, the game cannot run.
