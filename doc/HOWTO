Playing with the pre-made elements is fun, but wouldn't it be funner if you
could make your own? Well, you can! The configuration file is located in the
data folder (./data/config.txt) All of the pre-made elements are scripted out
in this file. Try studying them to get a feel for how the configuration works.
Making small changes to the pre-made elements is a good way to learn what's
going on.

Here is a quick reference to the command functions:

newElement(""): Creates a new element by name (all the commands following
apply to this)
enableEmit(): Particle emits energy (set emission with "setEmit")
enableBias(): Enable bias for particle energy (the bias is set with "setBias")
enableSharing(): Allow particle to share energy with its neighbors
enableMorphing(): Allow particle to morph between high and low energy states
enableClumping(): Enable clumping behavior
setHotkey(K): Sets a hotkey for this element
setRGB0(R, G, B): Set particle color for low energy state
setRGB1(R, G, B): Set particle color for high energy state
setGravity(l, h): Set gravity for low and high energy states (negative is
antigravity)
setSize(l, h): Set particle size for low and high energy states
setFriction(l, h): Set friction for low and high energy states (inverse
friction)
setEmit(e): Set energy for particle to emit (its neighbors will absorb it)
setBias(b): Set bias energy level (particle will settle at this energy level)
setColdState(""): Set element to transition into when energy level hits 0.0
setHotState(""): Set element to transition into when energy level hits 1.0
addReaction(A, B, X): When the particle hits the element type A, it
transitions into the element type B with a 1 in X chance of transition.

Blocks fit into the grid, do not move, and are not considered particles.
Examples of blocks are the Wall and Emitter types. They can be tangible or
intangible (passthrough).

newBlock(""): Creates a new block type by name
enableSolid(): Prevents elements from passing through this block
enableDestroy(): Destroys elements which touch this block
enableEmit(): Causes block to emit energy
enableVelocity(): Block will change velocity of elements touching it
setHotkey(K): Sets a hotkey for this block
setAppearance(A): Sets appearance of block. Options are UPARROW, DOWNARROW,
LEFTARROW, RIGHTARROW, COLOR
setRGB0(R, G, B): Set block color if appearance of block is COLOR
setVelocity(X, Y): Affects velocity of elements which touch this block
setEmit(e): Set energy for particle to emit
